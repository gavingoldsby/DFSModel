# DFSModel
This is a model used to predict the best possible team for NBA daily fantasy contests on DraftKings. It reads live lines on mybookie.com and uses a CSV file holding all 
players available that day and their stats to predict their performance. The project will run but without an updated CSV for that day it will not fully work as all players must
match with teams playing that day, because the live lines are read to maximize accuracy so you cannot go back to a previous date. I included some .txt files to show the output 
of the model as well as the CSV file that was used for these specific projections.
